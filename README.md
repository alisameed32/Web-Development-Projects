## üìå About Me

A Passionate Computer Science Student with a Focus on BCI

I'm Ali Sameed Arbani, a junior computer science student eager to explore the intersection of technology and neuroscience. My academic journey has ignited a deep interest in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs), and I'm driven to develop a BCI-related project for my Final Year Project (FYP).

To realize my vision, I plan to incorporate machine learning, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, hardware integration, data science, neuroscience, psychology, and other scientific concepts into my project. However, the high cost of hardware presents a significant challenge. As a college student, I'm currently limited by financial constraints.

To overcome this hurdle, I've expanded my skill set by learning web development and improving my freelancing abilities. By acquiring these practical skills, I aim to generate income and invest in the necessary hardware for my dream project.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I enjoy playing badminton, watching Netflix, studying geopolitics, and learning new languages. These hobbies offer a much-needed balance to my studies and fuel my creativity.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me for feedback or collaboration!
